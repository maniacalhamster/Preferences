Create shortcut in Windows Terminal
-----------------------------------o

$shell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
--------------------------------------------o
	- Creates an instance of WScript.Shell object, referring to it as 'shell'

$wt = $shell.CreateShortcut("$env:userprofile\Desktop\wt.lnk")
--------------------------------------------------------------o
	- Creates a shortcut with that shell instance with the .CreateShortcut command, referring
		to it as 'wt'
	- userprofile refers to User's 'home' directory, in this case wanting to store the 
		shortcut (wt.lnk) on the user's desktop
		
$wt
---o
	- Calling the wt shortcut itself will reveal the properties of the shortcut:
		FullName	- name of the shortcut with a full path to it (set upon creation)
		Arguments	- optional arguments to pass into the command
		Description	- descriptions user may want to specify
		Hotkey		- hotkey can be set to run the shortcut
		IconLocation	- path to file whose icon will be used for this shortcut
		RelativePath	- ??
		TargetPath	- path to the file that this shortcut will run
		WindowStyle	- ??
		WorkingDirectory  working directory when the target file is run from shortcut

	- User can change any of the properties by referring to said property and setting it to 
		a value (e.g. $wt.Hotkey='Alt+Ctrl+t')

$wt.Description='Shorcut for opening Windows Terminal (and applying hot key)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
	- Sets appropriate description for shortcut

$wt.HotKey='Alt+Ctrl+t'
-----------------------o
	- Sets up a hotkey for the shorcut (chose the shorcut for terminal in linux)


$wt.IconLocation=(ps | ? ProcessName -Match 'windowsterminal').path
-------------------------------------------------------------------o
	- Filters list of running process for 'windowsterminal' (case insensitive with -Match)
		and grabs only the path to pass into $wt's IconLocation property

$wt.TargetPath="$env:localappdata\Microsoft\WindowsApps\wt.exe"
--------------------------------------------------------------o
	- localappdata refers to Users AppData\Local\ directory and that is where wt.exe that
		runs windows terminal is stored

$wt.WorkingDirectory="$env:localappdata\Microsoft\WindowsApps\"
---------------------------------------------------------------o
	- again localappdata refers to Users AppData\Local directory where wt.exe is stored

$wt.save()
----------o
	- After all the property configurations are done with, the user saves which will finally
		'start' the shorcut (will pop up where it should be and will function as set up!)


EXTRA EXTRA
-----------
	I tend to prefer my shortcuts with hotkeys out of sight and out of mind, the path for the
	shortcut just being a necesity to set up a hotkey for that command than something I would
	want to point and click.
	The solution to this is to move it to the following address:
		[mv $env:userprofile\Desktop\wt.lnk $env:appdata\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\]
